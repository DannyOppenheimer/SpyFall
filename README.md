### SpyFall Website

# This repository is the code for the popular group-style game SpyFall. You will be able to create, join, and play SpyFall in seperate game rooms with a 5 letter key.

Note: The website is not hosted under Github pages. Rather, it is port forwarded under port 80.

How this Node app is hosted on Verizon:

> \1. Go to your default gateway, (most commonly 192.168.1.1) like you would access any other URL
> \2. You should be greeted by a page with configuration settings on in, after you type in your password
>   2a. If you see the option: "Port Forwarding, click on it and continue with step 3"
>   2b. If not, you can navigate to the Firewall settings and access port forwarding settings from there. 
> \3. In the drop down menu, select the computer that you would like to port forward to.
> \4. Your router might have presets for things like conventional ICMP, HTTP, and HTTPS, but if not type in the "desination" port on your computer with TCP.
> \5. Save/Apple changes.
> \6. You should be able to access your website through your public, or a set up static, IP address on the port you configured above.

# If you have any issues, suggestions, or other inquiries please leave a suggestion in the Issues section of this repo.
