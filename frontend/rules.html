			<h1 class="title">Instructions</h1>
			<p>Spyfall, a group-style game created in 2016, is fairly simple.</p>
			<p><strong>Main Idea:</strong></p>
			<p>
				When the round begins, a single location will be randomly selected. All the Players will be assigned the same location, but will have different roles.
				One player knows neither the location nor the roles assigned to other Players. This player is the spy, and his goal is to find out the location. If the
				spy finds out the location, then the spy wins, and if the Players figure out who the spy is, the Players win. This is achieved by asking other Players
				questions. The Players should ask questions that they think will reveal the spy, and the spy should ask questions that they think will reveal the
				location.
			</p>
			<br />
			<p><strong>Instructions</strong></p>
			<p>
				1: One player will create a room, the others will join with the provided key.
			</p>
			<p>
				2: One player will click "Start Game." You now can see your roles and location.
			</p>
			<p>
				3: Ask questions in the specified time period. The spy can guess the location at anytime. Once you get asked a question, it is your turn to ask another
				player.
			</p>
			<p>
				4: After the time limit ends, and the spy hasn't revealed themselves to guess yet, the players may vote on who they think the spy is
			</p>
			<p>5: If the players vote correctly, they win, otherwise the spy wins.</p>

			<p><strong>Have Fun!</strong></p>
